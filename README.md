# Odin-Project
A collection of all my projects from The Odin Project  curriculum, organized by module. Each project is preserved as a Git submodule to maintain its original repository, commit history, and timeline.This repo serves as a portfolio showcase of my full-stack web development journey, covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and more.
